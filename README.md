# how-to-react
Live code from [HTML5 Denver](http://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Denver-Users-Group/) on Mon, Feb 16, 2015

This repo was used for two HTML5 Denver talks. How to ReactJS covered the basics of React while building a very simple app. Tooling is Awesome added npm and webpack for package management and asset bundling.

Each directory is its own project:
* events-app: reference version of the app we built
* livecode: the live-coded version
* tooling-demo: reference version of the app with npm & webpack
* tooling-demo-livecode: the live-coded version
